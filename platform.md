# Platform Interface Specification

This document specifies the interface between a lifecycle and a platform.

A platform orchestrates a lifecycle to make buildpack functionality available to end-users such as application developers.

Examples of a platform might include:

1. A local CLI tool that uses buildpacks to create OCI images
1. A plugin for a continuous integration service that uses buildpacks to create OCI images
1. A cloud application platform that uses buildpacks to build source code before deployment

## Platform API Version

**Current Version**: 0.3

The Platform API version:
 - MUST be in form `<major>.<minor>` or `<major>`, where `<major>` is equivalent to `<major>.0`
 - When `<major>` is greater than `0` increments to `<minor>` SHALL exclusively indicate additive changes

### Lifecycle Compatibility

IF `CNB_PLATFORM_API=<major>[.<minor]` is set in the lifecycle's execution environment, the lifecycle MUST either
1. conform to the given version of the platform API specification

    or
1. fail if it does not support the requested API version

## Terminology

A **stack** is a contract defined by a base run OCI image and a base build OCI image that are only updated with security patches.
Stack images can be modified with mixins in order to make additive changes to the contract.

A **mixin** is a named set of additions to a stack that avoid changing the behavior of buildpacks or apps that do not depend on the mixin.

An **app image** refers to an OCI image generated by the lifecycle by extending the run image with any or all of the following: app layers, launch layers, launcher layers, image configuration

A **launch layer** refers to a layer in the app image created from a  `<layers>/<layer>` directory as specified in the [Buildpack Interface Specification](buildpack.md).

An **app layer** refers to a layer in the app image created from the `<app>` directory as specified in the [Buildpack Interface Specification](buildpack.md).

A **launcher layer** refers to a layer in the app OCI image containing the launcher itself and/or launcher configuration

The **launcher** refers to a lifecycle binary packaged in the app image for the purpose of executing processes at runtime

## Stacks
### Compatibility Guarantees

Stack image authors SHOULD ensure that build image versions maintain [ABI-compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) with previous versions, although violating this requirement will not change the behavior of previously built images containing app and launch layers.

Stack image authors MUST ensure that new run image versions maintain [ABI-compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) with previous versions.
Stack image authors MUST ensure that app and launch layers do not change behavior when the run image layers are upgraded to newer versions, unless those behavior changes are intended to fix security vulnerabilities.

Mixin authors MUST ensure that mixins do not affect the [ABI-compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) of any object code compiled to run on the base stack images without mixins.

During build, platforms MUST use the same set of mixins for the run image as were used in the build image (excluding mixins that have a stage specifier).

### Build Image

The platform MUST ensure that:

- The image config's `User` field is set to a non-root user with a writable home directory.
- The image config's `Env` field has the environment variable `CNB_STACK_ID` set to the stack ID.
- The image config's `Env` field has the environment variable `CNB_USER_ID` set to the UID of the user specified in the `User` field.
- The image config's `Env` field has the environment variable `CNB_GROUP_ID` set to the primary GID of the user specified in the `User` field.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.id` set to the stack ID.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.mixins` set to a JSON array containing mixin names for each mixin applied to the image.

### Run Image

The platform MUST ensure that:

- The image config's `User` field is set to a user with the same UID and primary GID as in the build image.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.id` set to the stack ID.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.mixins` set to a JSON array containing mixin names for each mixin applied to the image.

### Mixins

A mixin name MUST only be defined by the author of its corresponding stack.
A mixin name MUST always be used to specify the same set of changes.
A mixin name MUST only contain a `:` character as part of an optional stage specifier.

A mixin prefixed with the `build:` stage specifier only affects the build image and does not need to be specified on the run image.
A mixin prefixed with the `run:` stage specifier only affects the run image and does not need to be specified on the build image.

A platform MAY support any number of mixins for a given stack in order to support application code or buildpacks that require those mixins.

Changes introduced by mixins SHOULD be restricted to the addition of operating system software packages that are regularly patched with strictly backwards-compatible security fixes.
However, mixins MAY consist of any changes that follow the [Compatibility Guarantees](#compatibility-guarantees).

## Lifecycle Interface

### Build
To create an app image A platform MUST execute the following lifecycle phases

1. Detection
1. Analysis
1. Cache Restoration
1. Build
1. Export

either by executing the following phase specific lifecycle binaries
1. `/cnb/lifecycle/detector`
1. `/cnb/lifecycle/analyzer`
1. `/cnb/lifecycle/restorer`
1. `/cnb/lifecycle/builder`
1. `/cnb/lifecycle/exporter`

or by executing
1. `/cnb/lifecycle/creator`

### Rebase
To rebase an app image A platform MUST execute the `/cnb/lifecycle/rebaser` or perform an equivalent operation.
 
### Run
`/cnb/lifecycle/launcher` is responsible for launching user and buildpack provided processes in the correct execution environment.
`/cnb/lifecycle/launcher` SHALL be the `ENTRYPOINT` for all app images.


### Phases

The following is true of all lifecycle phases:

1. command line inputs ALWAYS take precedence over other inputs
1. IF `CNB_PLATFORM_API=<major>[.<minor]` is set in the lifecycle's execution environment, the lifecycle MUST do one the following before attempting to parse other inputs
    1. conform behavior to the given version of the platform API specification
    1. fail if it does not support the requested API version

### `detector`

* If none of `run-image.image` or `run-image.mirrors` has a registry matching that of `<image>`, `<run-image.image>` will become the `<run-image>`

#### Outputs
| Output             | Description

IF a cache is provided the lifecycle SHALL
* write `io.buildpacks.cache.metadata` to the cache
* ensure all `cache=true` layers are written to the cache

### `creator`
Usage:
```
/cnb/lifecycle/creator <image>
  [-app <app>] \
  [-cache-dir <cache-dir>] \
  [-cache-image <cache-image>] \
  [-daemon <use-daemon>] \
  [-gid <gid>] \
  [-launch-cache <launch-cache> ] \
  [-launcher <launcher> ] \
  [-layers <layers>] \
  [-log-level <log-level>] \
  [-order <order>] \
  [-platform <platform>] \

  [-skip-restore <skip-restore>] \
  [-stack <stack>] \
  [-tag <tag>...] \
  [-uid <uid> ]
```

Running `creator` SHALL be equivalent to running `detector`, `analzyer`, `restorer`, `builder` and `exporter` in order with identical inputs where they are accepted, with the following exceptions.

| Input             | Environment Variable| Default Value| Description
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------------
| `<previous-image>`| `CNB_PREVIOUS_IMAGE`| `<image>`    | Image reference to be analyzed (usually the result of the previous build)
| `<skip-restore>`  | `CNB_SKIP_RESTORE`  | `false`      | Do not write layer metadata or restore cached layers
| `<tag>...`        | -                   | -            | Additional tag to apply to exported image

If `<skip-restore>` is `true` the `creator` SHALL skip layer analysis and skip the entire Restore phase.
If the platform provides one or more `<tag>` inputs they SHALL be treated as additional `<image>` inputs to the `exporter`

Outputs produced by `creator` and identical to those produced by `exporter`.

If `<use-daemon>` is `false` and more than one `<image>` is provided they MUST refer to the same registry
If `<run-image>` is not provided by the platform the value will be derived from the contents of the `stack` key in the `io.buildpacks.lifecycle.metdata` label on `<image>`

| `<image>`          | Rebased app image (see [Buildpack Interface Specfication](buildpack.md)

The lifecycle SHALL write the same app image to each `<image>` tag
The rebased app image SHALL be identical to `<image>`, with the following modifications:
* Run image layers SHALL be defined as Layers in `<image>` up to and including the layer with diff ID matching the value of `run-image.top-layer` from the `io.buildpacks.lifecycle.metadata` label
* Run image layers SHALL be replaced with the layers from the new `<run-image>`
* The value of `io.buildpacks.lifecycle.metadata` SHALL be modified as follows
  * `run-image.reference` SHALL uniquely identify `<run-image>`
  * `run-image.top-layer` SHALL be set to the uncompressed digest of the top layer in `<run-image>`
  
### `launcher`
Usage:
```
/cnb/lifecycle/launcher [--] [args...]
```

| Input               | Environment Variable  | Default Value         | Description
|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------
| `<app>`             | `CNB_APP_DIR`         | `/workspace`          | Path to application directory
| `<layers>`          | `CNB_LAYERS_DIR`      | `/layers`             | Path to layer directory
| `<process-type>`    | `CNB_PROCESS_TYPE`    | `web`                 | `type` of process to launch
| `<direct>`          |                       | `false`               | Execution strategy for user provided process
| `<args>...`         |                       | -                     | User provided process
| `<layers>/config/metadata.toml`    |-       |-| Build metadata (see [metadata.toml (TOML)](#metdata.toml-(toml))
| `<layers>/<buildpack-id>/<layer>/` |-       |-| Launch Layers

If `$1` is `--` `<direct>` is `true` and `<args>` SHALL be `${@2:}`
If `$1` is anything other than `--`, `<direct>` is `false`, and `<args>` SHALL be `$@`
If `<direct>`

If `<args>` are NOT provided `launcher` SHALL select the process with `type` equal to `<process-type>` from `<layers>/config/metadata.toml` and launch it as described in the [Buildpack Interface Specification](buildpack.md).
If `<args>` are provided `launcher` SHALL behaves as if it selected a process with the following process from `metadata.toml`.
```
[[process]]
direct = <direct>
command = "args[0]"
args = ["args[1]"...]
```

The lifecycle SHOULD replace the lifecycle process in memory without forking it.
The process execution environment SHALL be identical to the lifecycle execution environment, with the following exceptions:
* `CNB_APP_DIR` SHALL NOT be set in the process environment
* `CNB_LAYERS_DIR` SHALL NOT be set in the process environment
* `CNB_PROCESS_TYPE` SHALL NOT be set in the process environment

## Buildpacks

### Buildpacks Directory Layout

The buildpacks directory MUST contain unarchived buildpacks such that:

- Each top-level directory is a buildpack ID.
- Each second-level directory is a buildpack version.

## Security Considerations

The platform SHOULD run each phase of the lifecycle in an isolated container to prevent untrusted app and buildpack code from accessing storage credentials needed during the export and analysis phases.
A more thorough explanation is provided in the [Buildpack Interface Specification](buildpack.md).

## Additional Guidance

### Environment

User-provided environment variables intended for build and launch SHOULD NOT come from the same list.
The end-user SHOULD be encouraged to define them separately.
The platform MAY determine the initial environment of the build phase, detection phase, and launch.
The lifecycle MUST NOT assume that all platforms provide an identical environment.

### Run Image Rebasing

Run image rebasing allows for fast stack updates for already-exported OCI images with minimal data transfer when those images are stored on a Docker registry.
When a new stack version with the same stack ID is available, the app layers and launch layers SHOULD be rebased on the new run image by updating the image's configuration to point at the new run image.
Once the new run image is present on the registry, filesystem layers SHOULD NOT be uploaded or downloaded.

The new run image MUST have an identical stack ID and MUST include the exact same set of mixins.

### Caching

Each platform SHOULD implement caching so as to appropriately optimize performance.
Cache locality and availability MAY vary between platforms.

## Data Format

### order.toml (TOML)

```toml
[[order]]
[[order.group]]
id = "<buildpack ID>"
version = "<buildpack version>"
optional = false
```

Where:

- Both `id` and `version` MUST be present for each buildpack object in a group.
- The value of `optional` MUST default to false if not specified.

### group.toml (TOML)

```toml
group = [
  { id = "<buildpack ID>", version = "<buildpack version>" }
]
```

Where:

- Both `id` and `version` MUST be present for each buildpack object in a group.

### analyzed.toml (TOML)

```toml
[image]
  reference = "<image reference>"

[metadata]
# layer metadata
```

Where:
- `image.reference` MUST be EITHER a digest reference to an image in a docker registry or the ID of an image in a docker daemon
- `metadata` MUST be the TOML representation fo the layer [metadata label](#layer-metadata-label-json)

### metadata.toml (TOML)
```toml
[[buildpacks]]
id = "<buildpack ID>"
version = "<buildpack Version>"
optional = false

[[processes]]
type = "<process type>"
command = "<command>"
args = ["<arguments>"]
direct = false

[[slices]]
paths = ["<app sub-path glob>"]

[bom]
```

Where:
- Both `id` and `version` MUST be present for each buildpack.

### project-metadata.toml (TOML)

```toml
[source]
type = "<source type>"

[source.version]
# arbitrary data

[source.metadata]
# arbitrary data
```

Where:
- All values are optional
- `type`, if present, SHOULD contain the type of location where the provided app source is stored (e.g `git`, `s3`)
- `version`, if present, SHOULD contain data uniquely identifying the particular version of the provided source
- `metadata` MAY contain additional arbitrary data about the provided source

### stack.toml (TOML)

```toml
[run-image]
 image = "<image>"

[run-image.mirrors] = ["<mirror>", "<mirror>"]
```

Where:
- `run-image.image` MAY be a reference to a run image in a docker registry
- `run-image.mirrors` MUST NOT be present IF `run-image.image` is not present
- `run-image.mirrors` MAY contain one or more tag references to run images in docker registries
- all `run-image.mirrors`:
  * SHOULD reference an image with ID identical to that of `run-image.image`
- `run-image.image` and `run-image.mirrors.[]` SHOULD each refer to a unique registry
